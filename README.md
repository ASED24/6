# Stick Mixing in Auto Mode

Hello everyone! 👋

## Update Overview
Exciting times! I've rolled out a new feature: **Stick Mixing in Auto Mode**. This lets you control the altitude of your waypoints directly through the throttle input. Imagine the flexibility and dynamic control you'll now have during your flights!

## How it works
1. Engage the auto mode.
2. While your drone navigates its waypoint path, manipulate the throttle input.
3. The upcoming waypoints will adjust their altitudes based on your throttle input, offering a real-time and intuitive altitude mixing experience.

## Testing & Verification
Before introducing this, I made sure it's rock solid:
- 🖥️ Tested extensively in the SITL (Software In The Loop) simulation.
- 🚁 Conducted hands-on tests with a real drone.

Both tests confirmed that the feature works seamlessly and as expected.

## Feedback
Your thoughts and feedback drive us forward! If you spot any quirks or have ideas for improvement, please raise an issue right here in the repo.

Happy flying and mixing! 🎮🚀
