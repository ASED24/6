# ArduPilot Project


Clone ArduPilot repository¶
“Cloning” is git’s term for making a local copy of a remote repository (i.e. one held on the GitHub servers).

Developers should clone the main ArduPilot repository (if they simply want to download and compile the latest code) or their own fork (if they want to make changes to the source code and potentially submit changes back).

Instructions for commonly used tools are below but whichever tool is used, the URL for the source repo will be required. This can be found on the right side of the screen on each Github repository home page but in general the URL is:

https://github.com/lmhonorio/ardupilot.git for the main ardupilot repo


Install some required packages¶
If you are on a debian based system (such as Ubuntu or Mint), we provide a script that will do it for you. From ardupilot directory :
````
Tools/environment_install/install-prereqs-ubuntu.sh -y
````

Reload the path (log-out and log-in to make permanent):
````
. ~/.profile
````
Now you should be able to build with waf as described in BUILD.md.

Cleaning¶
If there have been updates to some git submodules you may need to do a full clean build. To do that use:
````
./waf clean
````
that will remove the build artifacts so you can do a build from scratch

Setup for other Distributions Using the STM Toolchain¶
Add some directories to your search path (Facultative)¶
Note

ONLY if you didn’t run the install-prereqs script from previous step.

Add the following lines to the end of your “.bashrc” in your home directory (notice the . on the start of that filename. Also, this is a hidden file, so if you’re using a file manager, make sure to turn on “show hidden files”).

````

export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/ardupilot/Tools/autotest
export PATH=/usr/lib/ccache:$PATH
Then reload your PATH by using the “dot” command in a terminal

. ~/.bashrc
````

to run the mig6 boat

````
cd Rover
./gzboat.sh
````

to run the rover
````
cd Rover
./gzrover.sh
````

Now, both rover and boat are running the Rover code. The associate parameter to switch between vechicles is the SCR_USER5 where.
````
SCR_USER5 = 1 -- boat
SCR_USER5 = 2 -- rover
````
