# Altitude Control for Waypoints Using Throttle Input

Hello esteemed users,

## What's New?

We are pleased to announce the implementation of "Altitude Control for Waypoints." This feature empowers users to dynamically adjust the altitude of waypoints through throttle input, providing enhanced control during flights.

## How Does It Work?

1. Engage the auto mode.
2. As your drone follows its designated flight path, adjust the throttle input.
3. The system will modify the upcoming waypoints' altitudes based on your input, offering real-time responsiveness.

## Validation & Testing

Ensuring the safety and efficiency of our features is paramount:
- Rigorously tested in the SITL (Software In The Loop) environment.
- Further validated through field tests with a real drone.

Both testing methods have confirmed the robustness and reliability of this feature.

## Feedback and Suggestions

Your feedback is invaluable to our continuous improvement. Should you encounter any issues or have any suggestions, please do not hesitate to raise an issue in this repository.

Thank you for your trust and collaboration. Safe flights and we hope you appreciate the enhanced control.
