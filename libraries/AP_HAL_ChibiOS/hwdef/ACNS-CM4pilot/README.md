## GPIOs

All 8 PWM channels can be used for GPIO functions.
The pin numbers for these PWM channels in ArduPilot are shown below:

| PWM Channels | Pin  | PWM Channels | Pin  |
| ------------ | ---- | ------------ | ---- |
| PWM1         | 50   | PWM8         | 57   |
| PWM2         | 51   | 
| PWM3         | 52   | 
| PWM4         | 53   | 
| PWM5         | 54   | 
| PWM6         | 55   | 
| PWM7         | 56   | 

## Analog inputs

The CM4PILOT flight controller has 3 analog inputs
