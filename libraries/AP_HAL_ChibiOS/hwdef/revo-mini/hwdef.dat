# hw definition file for processing by chibios_pins.py
# for Revo(Mini) hardware


# building without actively adjusting options keeps using old_hwdef by default to avoid update surpises


# new default configuration uses:
# RCin on PWM input Ch1, that is 1st signal pin on RevoMini RC INPUT port or 3rd signal pin on fullsize Revo FlexIO port
# GPS tx / rx on PWM input Ch3/4, that is 3rd / 4th signal pin on Revomini RC INPUT port or 5th/6th signal pin on fullsize Revo FlexIO
# telem1 on mainport
# I2C on flexiport


# flexiport can be used as secondary telemetry port instead of I2C2
# SD option can be added for RevoMini, allowing external SD card adapter conncted to OPLink port using SPI


# chose only one of the below options:

include ../revo-mini/old_hwdef.dat
# include ../revo-mini/default.dat
# include ../revo-mini/flexiport_uart.dat

# include ../revo-mini/default_SD.dat
# include ../revo-mini/flexiport_uart_SD.dat
