COMPILING WITH PX4 (MYNGW) ON WINDOWS
-------------------------------------

You can compile from master-AVR branch, AntennaTracker, ArduPlane and APMRover for AVR generics Boards with I2C BUS0 enabled.

The next device are supported:
    
	- MPU60XX    Inertial Sensor.
	- HMC5883L   Compass Magnetometer.
	- MS5611     Barometer.

As default is enabled auxilliary pin from MPU60XX to route any atached I2C devices to this pins. Most generics boards are atached compass to this pin.



1. SOFTWARE TOOLS REQUIRED
--------------------------

These tools you need to download first.

  1.1 Arduino 1.0.3 with gcc-4.8.2 version download from this link:
  
          http://firmware.diydrones.com/Tools/Arduino/ArduPilot-Arduino-1.0.3-gcc-4.8.2-windows.zip
  
  
  1.2 PX4 toolchain, this one have MynGW already installed and enviroments settings, download from this link:
          
		  http://firmware.diydrones.com/Tools/PX4-tools/px4_toolchain_installer_v14_win.exe

  
  1.3 MissionPlanner, download from this link:
  
          http://ardupilot.com/downloads/
		  
		  
  
2. STEPS FOR COMPILING
----------------------

  2.1 Download and Decompress Arduino from section 1.1 to c:\arduino. You will see this order path c:\arduino\hardware\tools\avr\bin
  
  2.2 Download and install PX4 Toolchain from section 1.2 to c:\px4. You will see this order path C:\px4\toolchain\msys\1.0
  
  2.3 Doble click on C:\px4\toolchain\msys\1.0\px4_console.bat to execute PX4 command line tool.
  
  2.4 In prompt command line PX4 toolchain type the next command to export GNU compilers tools to system 'PATH' variable as follow:
      
	      $ export PATH=$PATH:/arduino/hardware/tools/avr/bin
      
	  With this export, you tell to 'make' search GNU compilers in this path that needed in the make process.
  
  2.5 In prompt command line PX4 tool type the next command to clone Ardupilot master-AVR branch as follow:
          
		  $ cd /c
		  $ git clone https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot.git
		  $ git checkout master-AVR
		  $ echo "ARDUINO=/c/arduino" > /c/ardupilot/config.mk
		  $ cd AntennaTracker
		  $ make atmega
  
  2.6 When it finished you can see the compiled code in the next file path:
  
      c:\user\yourusername\AppData\Local\Temp\AntennaTracker.build\AntennaTracker.hex
	  
  2.7 Now you can upload compiled code to your board with the Mission Planner: Initial Setup, Install Firmware screen’s, Load custom firmware link
      and navigate to your file hex compiled.
	  
	  

Enjoy!
