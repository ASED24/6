#APM Plus Hack#

We have made a hack of APM(ArduPilot Project). We add the osd to the APM board So we don't need another OSD module like miniosd.
The communication between autopilot and osd through SPI bus. So the refresh rate faster than miniosd.

#Code hack#
The code we have hack located in the branch PlaneOSD-3.2, CopterOSD-3.1.2 and CopterOSD-3.2.
